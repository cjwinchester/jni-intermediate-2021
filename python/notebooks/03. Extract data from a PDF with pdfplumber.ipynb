    "# Extract data from a PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to extract data from a PDF using the [pdfplumber library](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), which was developed primarily by [Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://www.jsvine.com/), currently at BuzzFeed News.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Note: This library works only on native PDFs (e.g. the text is selectable), not on scanned images. If you have a scanned image saved as a PDF, you'd first need to extract the text using some kind of Optical Character Recognition software (I'd suggest using [DocumentCloud](documentcloud.org/), which OCRs image PDFs on import, or a tool like [OCRMyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/).)\n",

    "This example extracts the data tables from a PDF that began life as a spreadsheet -- [a list of WARN notices in California](https://edd.ca.gov/Jobs_and_Training/Layoff_Services_WARN.htm#ListingofWARNNotices) -- but please note that this library is powerful enough to target specific pieces of data from pages using a number of highly customizable extraction strategies."
